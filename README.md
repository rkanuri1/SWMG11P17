## Problem Statement

Sellers want to maximize their revenue by making the products reach maximum users. The naive way of doing this is through advertisements. But advertisements are not specific for any potential customer .Recommendation systems aim at providing personalised options to the user based on several factors. This increases the chance of the product being selected by the user. The recommendations can also be personalised by tracking the interaction between the user and the application such as what movies he/she has watched, browsed, searched etc. As the system becomes more intelligent, there are several challenges which have to be addressed. One of them could be the Cold Start problem i.e. generating recommendations for a user who is using the application for the first time or a user for which much data is not available, so recommending new items becomes challenging

## Data

MovieLens dataset used to create recommendation sytem, due to a limitation on the hardware used a smaller set for training and evaluation

## Algorithms

Mainly developed recommendation system using Matrix factorisation methods and Autoencoders, 

1) For the matrix factorisation run the MatrixFactorisation.ipynb on google collab, upload the files from the data folder onto your personal drive and mount it to run the file.
2) Used KNN as a baseline model, the code for this is availble in MatrixFactorisation.ipynb as well
3) For the Autoencoders __


## Evaluations

The resulst of the algorithms were evaluated using RMSE and the final evaluations are availble in the evaluation folder
